Project Description: 
Our aim is to design a software tailored to solve the problem of mess management. The software must be smart, efficient and will make the function of the mess smooth and transparent. As stated in the Project Specifications, we hope to achieve this by coding in a smart and simple manner, making efficient use of resources. Our preference for using a GUI will make the application intuitive to it's users.

First Commit: 
This included Our Project Specifications and Use Case Diagrams.

Second Commit (09/11/2014): 
This includes Two Folders - One is 'UML Diagrams' and the other is 'Junit Tests'. We have used the EasyMock package to create mock objects for our unit tests. This Easy Mock package allows instantiation of interfaces, by treating them as classes. Attempting to run our junit tests on a computer that does not have the EasyMock package linked in the Eclipse libraries will throw compile time errors. It is thus recommended that the readers of our code have EasyMock installed and configured properly before they run our Junit tests.
